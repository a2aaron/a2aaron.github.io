        them!</p>

    <h3>Unfinished Bullet Hell Rhythm Game</h3>
    <p>A game written with the <a href="https://ggez.rs/">ggez game framework</a> meant to be a mashup of bullet hell

    <h3>Those Games I Made For EECS 494 (Intro to Game Development)</h3>
    <p>When I was in college, I took EECS 494, a game development class. I'm pretty happy with these games although
        they're a little janky on web (might want to download them)</p>
